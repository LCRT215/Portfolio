      "Firefly is a proof-of-concept application designed for how 4-6 year-old children learn - through play and experience. We created an innovative, open-ended coding environment that encourages experimentation by using React and animated SVGs to build an intuitive learning experience, which allows children to figure things out without feeling stuck. Firefly more accurately teaches what it means to be an engineer, with responsive interactions using drag and drop blocks that can be combined to code their own customizable fireflies.",
