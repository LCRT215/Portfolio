      "Firefly is a proof-of-concept application designed for how 4-6 year-old children learn - through play and experience. I functioned as a Full-Stack Developer on cross-functional team of 8 Web Developers and 2 UX Designers.We created an innovative, open-ended coding environment that encourages experimentation by using React and animated SVGs to build an intuitive learning experience, which allows children to figure things out without feeling stuck. Firefly more accurately teaches what it means to be an engineer, with responsive interactions using drag and drop blocks that can be combined to code their own customizable fireflies. This application was created to be used on a tablet.",

    // - As part of the creation process, tests must be performed on software to see how it measures up to expectations. Software project managers help determine what tests should be run and inspect the results for quality. They present a beta version to the client and select others for feedback.
    // - Software project managers look for ways to improve operations. They aim to do things better, faster, and cheaper whenever possible but without sacrificing quality.
    // - Lead the team members to perform their roles efficiently so that the project goals are achieved.
    // - Review and give individual feedback to improve the skills of the team members so that performance of the project improves overall.
