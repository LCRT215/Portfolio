          I'm a Full Stack Developer based in Philadelphia, PA with experience
          in creating responsive and interactive websites and apps using the
          latest technologies available. I have a passion for web design and
          love to create for web and mobile devices.

        I am currently enrolled in Lambda School's 9-month immersive Full Stack
        Web program, learning to design programs using the industry's latest
        technologies and will shortly finish the course on Computer Science with
        Web Development focus.
